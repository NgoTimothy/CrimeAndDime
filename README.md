# TC_3_CrimeDime Tycoon

CrimeAndDime is a tycoon game that was made with 3 other people for a school project.
The goal of the game is to have the most amount of money out of your competitors
after either a 30, 60 or 90 day period. 

Players run a store by stocking up on items and setting retail prices.
Stores also have a hidden market score that affects how many customers
come into the store. Market scores can be increased by certain actions
like marketing or they can be decreased by other stores attacks (Crime).

The frontend was written in Java and used LIBGDX. 
The backend was also written in Java and leveraged websockets and REST API's.
The database used MySQL.
