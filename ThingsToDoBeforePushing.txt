git add .
or if you only want to add some files you can do

git commit -m "Meaningful message"

Now before you push anything do the following
git status
If there are any differences that you don't want to lose do the following
git pull

Keep doing this for every branch that it is checked out from Ex. Master -> First Branch -> Second Branch If you are working on the second branch do the following commands for first and maser
Do the same git status and git pull
